# CSAcquisitionforECG
A merge and continuation of the Compressive sensing for audio project for ECG Signals. This work is focussed on trying to use compressive sensing for ECG acquisition 
and implement it with the developed filtering and peak detection process to achieve efficient ECG measurement and bpm calculation (The latter project is available at different repository : ECGfilteringandPeakDetection)
code modified and reffered from : Chen, Junxin, et al. "Compressed sensing for electrocardiogram acquisition in wireless body sensor network: A comparative analysis." International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks 15.7 (2019): 1550147719864884.
